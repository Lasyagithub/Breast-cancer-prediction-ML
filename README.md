Project Overview:
Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent and serious diseases affecting women worldwide. Early detection significantly increases survival chances. This project applies machine learning (ML) techniques to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant, using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset.
Tech Stack:
Languages: Python, NumPy, Pandas
ML Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost
Techniques Used:
Data Preprocessing & Feature Selection (handling missing values, encoding categorical data)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Seaborn & Matplotlib (Heatmaps, Correlation Analysis)
Machine Learning Models: SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Naive Bayes
Feature Engineering: Used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
Model Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
Key Results:
Achieved 96.5% accuracy with XGBoost, outperforming other ML models.
Random Forest & SVM also performed well, achieving 96% and 95.7% accuracy, respectively.
Top 3 features for prediction: radius_mean, concave points_worst, and area_mean.
Highlighted MLâ€™s potential in medical diagnosis, particularly in improving early breast cancer detection.
